# 4 week rules

My understanding of 4 week rules:
- If I buy some shares on 1st May, then sell on 15 May (within 28 days), then:
    - If I make profit, then I pay CGT on it
    - If I make a loss, then I cannot use this loss to offset against any other gains. Unless I re-acquire these shares within another 28 days. In that case I can offset the losses again any gains in the future on these specific shares.
        - Since this is complex to track, I chose to give up this loss and never use it for offsetting.
- If I buy some shares on 1 March, then sell on 15 May (>28 days), then:
     - If I make profit, then I pay CGT on it.
     - If I make loss, then:
         - If I re-acquire shares again within another 28 days, then I cannot use the loss for offsetting gains.
             - I can offset the losses against gains made on the re-acquired shares.
         - If I don't re-acquire shares within 28 days, then I can use the loss for offsetting gains. 
         
The similarity is that in both cases if I re-acquire the shares, then I can offset the losses against the gains on the new shares. The difference is that if the loss was on a purchase made more than 28 days ago, then assuming I don't re-acquire anything I can use the losses to offset gains as usual.

Example on Revenue states that loss on sale after purchase within 28 days cannot be used to offset other gains. However, in the Tax Consolidation Act (1997), Section 581 it does not say anything about it. It just says that for sale we should first sale any shares purchased in that last 4 weeks, and then use standard FIFO. It also says that we cannot use loss for offseting if we re-acquire shares within 28 days with exception of offsetting future gains by the same shares. I am confused by this, but I have zero experience with taxes, so I make this calculator to benefit Revenue when in doubt.


### 4 week rule in the Taxes Consolidation Act

- (1) covers that FIFO is adjusted when disposing shares within 4 weeks of purchase.
- (2) covers the case when we sell more than purchaesd in last 4 weeks. In this case we go back to standard FIFO.
- (3) covers the case when we make a sale with a loss, and then re-acquire fully or partly the shares sold in the next 4 weeks. In this case we cannot use the loss to offset gains made on other transactions within a year. We can use this loss to offset gains made by the shares re-acquired.

[ Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 Act 39 Section 581](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/39/section/581/enacted/en/html)

>  581.—(1) For the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Acts, where the same person in the same capacity disposes of shares of the same class as shares which such person acquired within 4 weeks preceding the disposal, the shares disposed of shall be identified with the shares so acquired within those 4 weeks.
        

> (2) For the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Acts, where the quantity of shares of the same class disposed of exceeds the quantity of shares of the same class acquired within the period of 4 weeks preceding the disposal, the excess shall be identified with shares of the same class acquired otherwise than within the period of 4 weeks.
        

> (3) Where a loss accrues to a person on the disposal of shares and such person reacquires shares of the same class within 4 weeks after the disposal, that loss shall not be allowable under section 538 or 546 otherwise than by deduction from a chargeable gain accruing to such person on the disposal of the shares reacquired; but, if the quantity of shares so reacquired is less than the quantity so disposed of, such proportion of the loss shall be allowable under section 538 or 546 as bears the same proportion to the loss on the disposal as the quantity not reacquired bears to the quantity disposed of.

### Why use FIFO within 4 weeks vs LIFO

The previous act says " the shares disposed of shall be identified with the shares so acquired within those 4 weeks.". We get more clarification in one of the Revenue's manuals.

> 6A.3.1 Disposal of shares within four weeks of acquisition

> The FIFO rules are modified in any case where shares of the same class are bought
and sold within a period of four weeks. Where shares are sold within four weeks of
acquisition the shares sold are identified with the shares acquired within that period.
Furthermore, where a loss accrues on the disposal of shares and shares of the same
class are acquired within a four week period, the loss is not available for offset
against any other gains arising and instead is only available for set off against any
gain that might arise on the subsequent disposal of the shares so acquired in the
four week period - this provision does not apply where there is a gain on the
disposal

> Section 581 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (“TCA 1997”) is an anti-avoidance
measure which is designed to limit the manipulation of capital losses by disposals
and reacquisitions of shares or securities within a short time. It applies to shares and
securities of the same class which are acquired and disposed of by the same person
in the same capacity within 4 weeks. Section 581 TCA 1997 also prevents the
manipulation of losses by the device of selling shares or securities with the intention
of realising a loss for set-off against gains on other disposals and thereafter
reacquiring the shares or securities of the same class within 4 weeks of their
disposal.

> 3.1 Disposals of shares or securities within 4 weeks of acquisition
A special rule applies to shares or securities or any other assets dealt in without
identifying the particular assets disposed of or acquired where such assets are
acquired and disposed of by the same person in the same capacity within 4 weeks.
Under normal rules, the asset purchased first is treated as the first asset sold (the
first in first out (FIFO) rule) but under this rule where there is a sale within four
weeks after a purchase the item treated as sold is the asset purchased within four
weeks of the sale and not the asset acquired earlier.
The normal rules of identification apply to any excess where the quantity disposed of
exceeds the quantity recently acquired. In the event of a sale of shares followed by a
re-acquisition within four weeks a loss on the sale will be allowed only against gains
derived from the disposal of the shares re-acquired within four weeks. Where the
reacquisition involves a fraction only of the shares sold the restriction will be
confined to a corresponding fraction of the loss.

#### Loss on sale after purchase within 28 days

The Act does not says anything about loss on sale made within 4 weeks of the purchase when the shares were not re-acquired. But Example 2 on revenue's website shows that we cannot use this loss. This is confusing and not convincing.

> Shares sold within four weeks of acquisition

> Shares bought and sold within a four-week period cannot be offset against other gains.
> You can only deduct the loss from a gain made on a subsequent disposal of same-class shares acquired within the four weeks.


Example 2
> On 1 April 2017, both Jane and Kevin individually bought 3,000 ordinary shares in Abcee Ltd for €3,000.

> They both then sold their shares on 14 April 2017 for €2,000, making a loss of €1,000.

> Jane did not buy any more ordinary shares in Abcee Ltd within four weeks making the loss. She cannot set her loss against any gain she may make.

> Kevin bought more ordinary shares in Abcee Ltd on 21 April 2017. If Kevin makes a gain on the disposal of these shares in the future, he can deduct his loss of €1,000.
